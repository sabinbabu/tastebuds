                  <p>To make bacon strips and melted cheese-topped fries, start by preparing your fries using your preferred method. You can use frozen fries and bake them according to the package instructions, usually at around 425°F (220°C) for 20-25 minutes, or cook them in an air fryer at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. </p>

                  <p>To make a delicious cooked rice with vegetable salad, start by preparing 1 cup of rice according to package instructions, usually by rinsing the rice under cold water, then cooking it in 2 cups of water brought to a boil. Once the water boils, reduce the heat, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed. </p>

                <p>To make a Fruit Volcano, begin by selecting a variety of fresh fruits such as pineapples, strawberries, kiwis, blueberries, and grapes. Cut the fruits into bite-sized pieces, making sure to keep a balance of colors and flavors. Take a large, round fruit, such as a watermelon or a pineapple, and cut off the top third, hollowing out the inside to create a bowl. Reserve the scooped-out fruit for later use. Place the hollowed fruit on a large serving platter.</p>
